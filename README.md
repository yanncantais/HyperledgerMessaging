# Step by step

# I. Set up the indy pool:

To create an indy pool, you will need to install the necessary software and dependencies on a server or cloud-based environment. This typically involves downloading the indy-sdk and other required libraries, and then configuring the pool to meet your specific requirements.

## 1. Install the indy-sdk:

The first step is to download and install the indy-sdk, which is the software package that provides the core functionality for an indy pool. This typically involves using a package manager such as pip or conda to download and install the indy-sdk and its dependencies.

## 2. Create a pool configuration:

Next, you will need to create a configuration file that specifies the details of your indy pool, such as its name and the network on which it will operate. This configuration file typically uses a JSON format, and it will be used to initialize and manage your indy pool.

1. Create a new file: The first step is to create a new file using a text editor or other tool. This file will contain the configuration for your indy pool, and it will typically use a JSON format.

2. Specify the pool name: Next, you will need to specify the name of your indy pool in the configuration file. This name should be unique within the network on which your pool will operate, and it will be used to identify and distinguish your pool from other pools on the network.

3. Specify the network: After specifying the pool name, you will need to specify the network on which your pool will operate. This could be an existing network such as the Indy Test Network, or it could be a custom network that you have created for your specific use cases.

4. Specify the pool Genesis transactions: In addition to the pool name and network, you will also need to specify the pool Genesis transactions in your configuration file. These transactions are special transactions that are used to initialize the pool's ledger and storage components, and they must be specified in the configuration file in order for the pool to function correctly.

5. Save the configuration file: After you have specified all of the necessary details in the configuration file, you can save it in a convenient location. This file will be used to initialize and manage your indy pool, so it's important to keep it in a safe and secure place.

## 3. Initialize the pool:

Once you have created the pool configuration, you can use the indy-sdk to initialize the pool and create the necessary ledger and storage components. This typically involves running a command-line utility provided by the indy-sdk, and passing it the path to your pool configuration file.

1. Run the **`pool_create`** command: After you have created the pool configuration file, you can use the indy-sdk to initialize the pool. This typically involves running the **`pool_create`** command provided by the indy-sdk, and passing it the path to your pool configuration file as an argument.

2. Verify the pool: After the **`pool_create`** command has been run, you can use the indy-sdk or other relevant tools to verify that the pool has been initialized correctly. This typically involves running the **`pool_list`** command to list all of the pools on the network, and then checking that your pool is included in the list.

## 4. Start the pool:

After the pool has been initialized, you can start it by running another command-line utility provided by the indy-sdk. This will launch the pool and make it available for use by other indy clients and applications.

## 5. Configure the pool

Finally, you will need to configure your indy pool to meet your specific requirements and use cases. This may involve modifying the pool configuration file, setting up custom roles and policies, and enabling features such as support for multi-signature transactions.

# II. Create and configure the mobile wallets:

Next, you will need to create and configure the Aries mobile wallets that will be used by the users of your messaging app. This typically involves installing the wallet software on the users' mobile devices, and then configuring the wallets to connect to your indy pool.

## 1. Install the necessary software and dependencies: 
The first step is to download and install the software and libraries that are required to create a mobile wallet. This typically involves using a package manager such as pip or conda to download and install the indy-sdk and other relevant libraries, as well as any platform-specific libraries or frameworks that are needed to build a mobile app.
## 2. Create the user interface: 
Next, you will need to design and implement the user interface for your mobile wallet. This typically involves using a GUI framework or library to create the various screens and components that will make up the wallet, and then implementing the logic and functionality for each of these components.
## 3. Connect the wallet to the indy pool: 
After the user interface has been implemented, you will need to implement the functionality for connecting the wallet to an indy pool. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to establish a connection with the pool, and then authenticating and verifying the wallet's identity with the pool.
## 4. Implement the core functionality: 
Once the wallet is connected to the indy pool, you can begin implementing the core functionality for sending and receiving messages and other data. This typically involves using the indy-sdk and other relevant libraries to encode and decrypt the messages, and then store them securely on the indy pool.
## 5. Test and debug the app: 
As you are developing the wallet, it's important to test and debug it regularly to ensure that it is functioning correctly and meeting your requirements. This typically involves setting up test cases and running the app against them to check for errors and other issues, and then using a debugger or other tools to diagnose and fix any problems that are discovered.
## 6. Deploy and maintain the app: 
Once you have finished developing the wallet and tested it thoroughly, you can deploy it to a production environment and make it available to users. This typically involves packaging the app and its dependencies, and then deploying them to an app store or other online repository. You will also need to monitor and maintain the app over time to ensure that it continues to function correctly and meet the needs of your users.

# III. Process the connection between users:

To enable users to send messages to each other, you will need to implement a process for establishing connections between their mobile wallets. This typically involves using digital identifiers and cryptographic keys to verify the identity of the users and establish a secure channel for communication.

## 1. Generate digital identifiers: 
The first step is to generate unique digital identifiers for each user's mobile wallet. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to generate a random string of characters that will serve as the user's digital ID.
## 2. Exchange digital identifiers: 
Next, you will need to implement a mechanism for the users to exchange their digital identifiers with each other. This could be done using a messaging or chat interface within the app, or using a separate communication channel such as email or SMS.
## 3. Verify the digital identifiers: 
After the users have exchanged their digital identifiers, you will need to implement a process for verifying that the identifiers are valid and belong to the correct users. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to query the indy pool and confirm that the digital IDs are registered and associated with the correct users.
## 4. Generate cryptographic keys: 
Once the digital identifiers have been verified, you will need to generate cryptographic keys for the users' mobile wallets. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to generate a private/public key pair for each user, and then storing the keys securely in the users' mobile wallets.
## 5. Establish a secure channel: 
After the cryptographic keys have been generated, you can use them to establish a secure channel for communication between the users' mobile wallets. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to encrypt and decrypt the messages using the users' keys, and then transmit them over the network.

# IV. Implement the messaging functionality:

Finally, you will need to implement the functionality for sending and receiving messages between the users' mobile wallets. This typically involves using the indy-sdk and other relevant libraries to encode and decrypt the messages, and then store them securely on the indy pool.

## 1. Encode the messages: 
The first step is to encode the messages that are sent between the users' mobile wallets. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to encrypt the messages using the users' cryptographic keys, and then encode the encrypted messages in a format that can be transmitted over the network.
## 2. Decrypt the messages: 
After the messages have been encoded, you will need to implement a mechanism for decrypting them when they are received by the recipient's mobile wallet. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to decrypt the messages using the recipient's private key, and then decode the encrypted message to reveal its original content.
## 3. Store the messages on the indy pool: 
Once the messages have been decrypted, you will need to implement a mechanism for storing them securely on the indy pool. This typically involves using the indy-sdk or other relevant libraries to write the messages to the pool's ledger or storage system, using the appropriate permissions and policies.
## 4. Retrieve the messages from the indy pool: 
Finally, you will need to implement a mechanism for retrieving the messages from the indy pool when it has received it.
